# Personal Values Survey

For 30 years people have used a Personal Values Questionnaire which ranks a person’s answers into 10 specific value groups which helps an individual discover much about the values which matter most to them. Common Cause Australia aims to bring this questionnaire to the general public in a format reflective of the times. It has requested that an ANU Tech launcher team assist in the development of a website which provides the functionality of the questionnaire in an easily accessible and visually appealing format.

## Project Overview

#### Project Scope & Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop a website hosted Personal Values Questionnaire which will collect user information with a survey and assess their values based on preexisting models provided by Common Cause Australia. The service should display a graphical representation of the data collected from the user and be able to compare it to the values of other users who have completed the survey. Additionally, the site should have the ability to share the results of a user’s questionnaire with various social media sites. 

Details in [Statement of Work - 3 scope](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ooCDWrFfx0ZvHPXHtY1BuWsE3_zYZ7ML1lkHwDKBcCk/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Client's Expectation & Vision

This project is purposed to last for one semester. By the end of the project, minimum variable product is expected to be delieverd, i.e. the website could be able to help people conduct the survey and view the pretty diagrams generated from their results.

A particularly customized online personal values survey helps the client collect first-hand data and can even analyse data from a partcular group or organization. At the same time, when survey users get access to survey pages, potentially client's websites and his organization can be also promoted. Moreover, the client requires an impressive and attractive survey webpage with perfect interactions and visualization of survey results.

## Stakeholders

#### Client

Our client, Mark Chenery expect that this project could provide a solution for personal values survey so that he could use it as a tool for training people and widespread it on social media and collect useful data for further research. He provides the list of survey questions, the algorithm for analysing data and data structure.

#### User

The users of the product of the project would be people who are being trained for work. This project could provide them with a tool so that they could learn about their personal values and develop themselves according to the analysis. Also, they could share their personal values result with others.

## Project Management

#### Approach

Agile project management approach would be used for the project. To be more specific, requirements are analysed using user story techniques, the timeline is divided into sprints for development process, etc.

#### Communication

We are using Slack for team communication and we contact our client via email or phone.

#### Tracibility

We are using [Zenhub](https://github.com/Jingyi-Lu/PersonalValues#workspaces/personalvalues-5c847a088c3c284b9ea195c2/reports/burndown?milestoneId=4126219) for tracking the progress for technical issues. 

And we are using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/jWCw4csg/online-personal-value) for tracking the progress for non-technical issues.

#### Documentation

Documentation is collected on the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JXmdufWA4A6IveU9PfW6OlN-o3qMd_8U), including decision making, risk analysis, meeting minutes, reflections, etc.
